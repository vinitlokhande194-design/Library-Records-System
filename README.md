# Library Records System

## Project Overview

Library Records System is a Java-based application developed using JDBC, MySQL, DAO Design Pattern, and Object-Oriented Programming concepts. The system manages books, library members, book issue transactions, and fines.

The project demonstrates concepts such as:

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Abstraction
- Runtime Polymorphism
- DAO Design Pattern
- JDBC Connectivity
- MySQL Database Integration

---

## Technologies Used

- Java
- JDBC
- MySQL
- NetBeans IDE
- DAO Pattern
- OOP Concepts

## Object-Oriented Concepts Used

### Encapsulation

Private variables with getter and setter methods.

Example:

```java
private String title;

public String getTitle()
{
    return title;
}

public void setTitle(String title)
{
    this.title = title;
}
```

### Abstraction

```java
public abstract class Member
```

### Inheritance

```java
public class StudentMember extends Member

public class FacultyMember extends Member
```

### Runtime Polymorphism

```java
Member member;

member = new StudentMember();

member = new FacultyMember();

member.getBorrowLimit();
```

---

## DAO Design Pattern

The project follows DAO architecture to separate business logic from database logic.

```text
Main Program
      ↓
DAO Interface
      ↓
DAO Implementation
      ↓
JDBC
      ↓
MySQL
```

Advantages:

- Better maintainability
- Reusable code
- Separation of concerns

- book_id
- title
